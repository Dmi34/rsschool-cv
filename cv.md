## About me
Dmitry Antashkevich, 17 y.o., school student. Three years ago Iâ€™ve become passionate about competition programming (cp). I started in *Pascal*, then in *C++*.  My main achievements in cp: **absolute winner of BelOI-2022 (final stage of republican Olympiad in Belarus) and bronze medalist on IOI-2022**.

About a year ago I started to develop in different programming directions (big data, back-end, etc.) and recently decided to learn basic front-end and web-programming.
