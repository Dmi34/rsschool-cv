## About me
Dmitry Antashkevich, 17 y.o., school student. Three years ago Iâ€™ve become passionate about competition programming. I started in *Pascal*, then in *C++*.  My main achievements: **absolute winner of BelOI-2022 (final stage of republican Olympiad in Belarus) and bronze medalist on IOI-2022**.

About a year ago I started to develop in different programming directions (big data, back-end, etc.) and recently decided to learn basic front-end and web-programming.

## Skills

* C++
* Python
* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* JS Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code
* QT
* Algorithms

## Code Example
```
function calculate() {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) 
    sum += arguments[i];
  return function() {
    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) 
      sum += arguments[i];
    return sum;
  };
}
```

## Experience
I have no impressive practical experience. I can only mention data analysis with *Python* and simple *C++* applications, but I hope to have a serious project soon.

## Education

* Gymnasium
* Self-education
* Yandex intensives: big data (in progress)
* JavaScript/Front-end 2022Q3 (in progress)

## English
**B1**
